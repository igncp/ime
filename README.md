Proof of concept of an IME (Input Method Editor) for IBus written in JS

Using [Rime](https://github.com/rime/ibus-rime) as the base for the setup

This is WIP and in a very early stage. The current objectives are:

- Create Node.js bindings for [ibus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus) (for Linux) which is written in C
- Have a proof of concept of IME with very few features using IBus and Rime configuration files and dictionaries
